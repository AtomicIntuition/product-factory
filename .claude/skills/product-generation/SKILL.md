When generating a product:

1. Read the research report for the target opportunity
2. Determine product type: template, prompt pack, guide/ebook, toolkit, script, cheat sheet
3. Generate the actual product content — this must be genuinely high quality, not filler
4. Generate listing copy: title (SEO optimized for Gumroad search), description (benefit-driven, scannable), tags
5. Set pricing based on competitor analysis (typically undercut top sellers by 20-30% for initial traction)
6. Generate a thumbnail description that can be used with an image generation tool
7. Package everything and save to supabase products table with status "ready_for_review"

Quality bar: every product should be something you'd actually pay for. No thin content. No obvious AI slop.
