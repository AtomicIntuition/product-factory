When performing market research:

1. Identify the target category/niche
2. Gather data on existing products: titles, descriptions, pricing, ratings, review count, seller info
3. Analyze patterns: what's selling, what's overpriced, what has bad reviews (opportunity), what's missing
4. Score opportunities by: demand (search/sales volume), competition (how many similar products), gap size (unmet need), feasibility (can we generate this?)
5. Output a structured research report with top 5 opportunities ranked by score
6. Save the report to supabase research_reports table

Always think like a buyer: "Would I pay for this? Is the existing option good enough or is there clear room for improvement?"
